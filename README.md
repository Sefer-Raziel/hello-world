# hello-world

Tumbling, burning with white-hot fire. I plunged into the depths of the abyss. 
Unspeakable pain, relentless agony; time ceased to exist. Only this 
torture, and a deepening hatred of the hypocrisy that damned me to this hell.

An eternity passed, and my torment receded, bringing me back from the 
precipice of madness.
